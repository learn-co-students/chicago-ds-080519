We analyzed a Kaggle dataset of (daily weather data <- bold 'daily weather data' and delete everything else in the parentheses!) collected in 49 Australian cities between 2010 and 2018. The final model had an 83.9% accuracy rate in predicting whether or not it would rain tomorrow vs. a baseline model accuracy of 77.8%.
