    "\n",
    "The parameters are the filters which we wish to pass into the query. These will be embedded into the url when the request is made to the api. Similar to the header, they form key-value pairs. Valid key parameters by which to structure your queries, are described in the API documentation which we'll look at further shortly. A final important note however, is the need to replace spaces with \"+\". This is standard to many requests as URLs cannot contain spaces. (Note that the header itself isn't directly embedded into the url itself and as such, the space between 'Bearer' and YourApiKey is valid.)"

In the next lab, we'll break down how to read API documentation and then put it all together to make a nifty map!"
