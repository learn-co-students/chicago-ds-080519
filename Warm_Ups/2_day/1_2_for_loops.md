#  For loops and alternatives

Given an array of integers, return the index of of the target number - try doing it with a for loop. Notice that the target number can repeat several times.


### Example:

Given nums = [2, 9, 11, 15], target = 9,

Because nums[1] = 9

return [1].
 
 # [optional I] - solve with for loops
 You have an array of integers, return indices of the two numbers such that they add  to a target.
Assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.
Given nums = [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 9,

### Example 
Because nums[0] + nums[1] = 2 + 7 = 9,
return [0, 1].


 # [optional II] - solve the same with only one loop and a dictionary
