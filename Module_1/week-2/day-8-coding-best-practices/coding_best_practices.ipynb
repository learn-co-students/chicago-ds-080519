    "> 1) **correctness**: does the code produce the correct answer? (For numerical problems, this requires some care: for the example of the differential equation, we would expect for a well-behaved differential equation that the numerical solution converges towards the exact solution as the step-width is reduced towards zero.) <br>\n",
    "> 2) **execution time performance**: how fast is the solution computed? <br>\n",
    "> 3) **memory consumption**: how much RAM is required to compute the solution? <br>\n",
    "> 4) **robustness?**: how robust is the implementation with respect to missing/incorrect input values, etc?<br>\n",
    "> 5) **elegance, readability, documentation**: how long is the code? Is it easy for others to understand? Is it easy to extend? Is it well documented, or is the choice of algorithm, data structures and naming of objects sufficient to document what it does?\n",

    "> Stephen C. Johnson, a computer scientist at Bell Labs, came up with lint in 1978 while debugging the Yacc grammar he was writing for C and dealing with portability issues stemming from porting Unix to a 32-bit machine. The term \"lint\" was derived from the name of the undesirable bits of fiber and fluff found in sheep's wool. In 1979, lint was used outside of Bell Labs for the first time in the seventh version  of the Unix operating system. - [wikipedia source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lint_(software))"
