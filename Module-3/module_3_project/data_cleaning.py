This module is for your data cleaning.
It should be repeatable.

## PRECLEANING
There should be a separate script recording how you transformed the json api calls into a dataframe and csv.

## SUPPORT FUNCTIONS
There can be an unlimited amount of support functions.
Each support function should have an informative name and return the partially cleaned bit of the dataset.
